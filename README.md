# SpaceX Data Analysis

This project is a result of my participation in IBM Data Science Professional Certification where I developed and honed my hands-on skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding and application of the concepts and skills learned throughout the course.

## Project Description
This project is about predicting if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
